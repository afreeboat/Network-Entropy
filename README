Modular entropy calculation from network capture
================================================

The project objective is to use a pcap file (or a live pcap stream) to calculate the entropy of the TCP and UDP payload of packets seen using different
algorithms

First Step: Packet entropy calculation from capture file
========================================================

We are trying to calculate entropy of packets from a capture file using 2 algorithms:
 - shannon entropy
 - an approximation of kolmogorov entropy by using the compression rate of the packet
